# Gamma correlations

This section of the validation report shows the effect of angular correlations
after emission of multiple gammas after a decay. As an example: The background
rate of Co-60 depends on both gammas hitting one detector, so the angle between
the gammas matter.

See [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/372884/contributions/1792361/)
for more background on the calculation.
