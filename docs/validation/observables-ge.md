# HPGe observables

This section of the validation report involves basic
simulation of observables of interest for HPGe detectors. The 
dependence of these observables on user inputs, for example:

- step limits,
- production cuts,
- physics lists,

is computed, allowing for a user to determine appropriate choices 
for their simulation.

The geometry is based on a cylinder of natural Germanium (height and radius both
4 cm), emersed in a liquid argon sphere, with a small Fe calibration source
above the detector.

This geometry is shown below, for gamma particles generated in the source.

Geometry for the tests on Ge observables, gamma primaries are generated in the 
source (shown in white).
