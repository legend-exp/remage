# Experimental geometry

_remage_ does not implement or manage any experimental geometry. Instead, the
user must provide a geometry definition. There are two supported approaches:

- Supply one or more [GDML](https://gdml.web.cern.ch) files via the
  [command line](./running.md) or using the macro command
  <project:../rmg-commands.md#rmggeometryincludegdmlfile>.
- Override {cpp:func}`RMGHardware::DefineGeometry` in a subclass of
  `RMGHardware` and register it using {cpp:func}`RMGManager::SetUserInit`. A
  practical example is in `examples/02-hpge`.

:::{seealso}

The [pyg4ometry](https://pyg4ometry.readthedocs.io) Python library provides
powerful tools for building Monte Carlo geometries and exporting them as GDML.
Relevant pyg4ometry-based packages include:

- [legend-pygeom-tools](https://legend-pygeom-tools.readthedocs.io) – general
  geometry routines and extensions
- [legend-pygeom-hpges](https://legend-pygeom-hpges.readthedocs.io) –
  high-purity germanium detector models
- [legend-pygeom-optics](https://legend-pygeom-optics.readthedocs.io) – optical
  properties for Geant4 materials

Full geometry implementations based on these tools:

- [legend-pygeom-l200](https://github.com/legend-exp/legend-pygeom-l200) –
  LEGEND-200
- [legend-pygeom-l1000](https://github.com/legend-exp/legend-pygeom-l1000) –

## Registering sensitive detectors

Sensitive detector volumes must be registered so that particle interactions are
recorded in the output. In _remage_, this can be done in several ways. Each
detector has a unique id (UID) and a _type_, which determines how hits in a
physical volume (or in a group of them) are processed and stored. Detector of
type `Germanium`, `Scintillator` and `Optical` are currently supported, see
{ref}`manual-output` for more details.

:::{note}

User-defined detector types cannot currently be registered at runtime.

:::

The simplest method is to use the
<project:../rmg-commands.md#rmggeometryregisterdetector> macro command:

```geant4
/RMG/Geometry/RegisterDetector Germanium B00000B 1
/RMG/Geometry/RegisterDetector Germanium C000RG1 2 1
```

This registers the physical volume `B00000B`, and the `C000RG1` volume with copy
number `1` as `Germanium` detectors with UIDs 1 and 2 respectively. Because for
`B00000B` no copy number was specified, this will register all `B00000B` named
volumes if there are multiple with different copy numbers. This command now also
accepts regex patterns (respecting the
[default `std::regex_match` grammar](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript.html)):

```geant4
/RMG/Geometry/RegisterDetector Germanium B.* 1
```

registers all physical volumes starting with `B`. If there are multiple volumes
matching the pattern, they will all be registered alphabetically under
incrementing UIDs. This means the first alphabetical `B.*` match will be
registered under UID 1, the second match will be registered with UID 2 and so
on. It is therefore the responsibility of the user to make sure that no UID will
be duplicated, which is detected by _remage_ and results in an error.

Alternatively, one might want to assign the same UID to multiple physical
volumes, i.e. as if they constitute a single detector unit. In such a scenario,
there would be no way to distinguish hits from different volumes in the
simulation output (except from the coordinates in post-processing). In this
case, the fifth argument (`allow_uid_reuse`) has to be set to `true`:

```geant4
/RMG/Geometry/RegisterDetector Germanium .*_cu_.* 1 .* true
```

This would register any volume with name matching the regular expression
`.*_cu_.*` under the UID 1. In this case the UIDs will **not** be incremented
for multiple matches.

Last but not least, detectors can be imported from a GDML file that includes
metadata, using the
<project:../rmg-commands.md#rmggeometryregisterdetectorsfromgdml> command.

:::{tip}

The `legend-pygeom-tools` package automatically includes such metadata when
writing GDML with {func}`pygeomtools.write.write_pygeom`.

## Inspecting geometry

To inspect the simulation geometry, use the following macro commands:

- <project:../rmg-commands.md#rmggeometryprintlistoflogicalvolumes>
- <project:../rmg-commands.md#rmggeometryprintlistofphysicalvolumes>

Example session:

```remage
remage> /RMG/Geometry/IncludeGDMLFile geometry.gdml
remage> /run/initialize
G4GDML: Reading 'geometry.gdml'...
G4GDML: Reading definitions...
G4GDML: Reading materials...
G4GDML: Reading solids...
G4GDML: Reading structure...
G4GDML: Reading userinfo...
G4GDML: Reading setup...
G4GDML: Reading 'geometry.gdml' done!

```

:::{tip}

As seen above, the Geant4 overlap checker is enabled by default if GDML input is
provided. It can be disabled with the
<project:../rmg-commands.md#rmggeometrygdmldisableoverlapcheck> command.
