# Installation

## Pre-built binaries

The recommended and fastest way of running _remage_ is through pre-built
software containers. Stable releases are regularly made available
[on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/legendexp/remage). To obtain and run
the latest just do:

```console
$ docker run legendexp/remage:latest --help # just prints a help message
```

If you prefer [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/), you can easily generate an
image locally:

```console
$ apptainer build remage_latest.sif docker://legendexp/remage:latest
$ apptainer run remage_latest.sif --help
```

If containers do not work for you, see the next section to learn how to build
and install from source.

## Building from source

In preparation for the actual build, users are required to obtain some
dependencies.

```{include} ../_dependencies.md

```

### Building

The build system is based on CMake.

```{important}
It is important that you **use a unique install prefix** for remage. **Do not
use a location that is controlled by your linux package manager** (i.e.
`/usr`). The default value of `/usr/local` is also dangerous if you install
other software into that prefix. Failing to do so might create conflicts with
other python packages or might even render your system unusable.
```

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/legend-exp/remage
$ cd remage
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<unique prefix> ..
$ make install
```

## Setting up Jupyter

To set up a _remage_-aware Jupyter kernel, you only have to provide the correct
`kernel.json` file to your Jupyter installation.

```console
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/remage
$ touch ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/remage/kernel.json
```

:::{note}

If Jupyter is installed inside a virtual environment (or in VSCode your default
Python interpreter is inside a virtual environment) then you probably need to
add the `kernel.json` to the `share` folder of that Jupyter installation
instead.

:::

If you have installed _remage_ from a pre-built binary using Apptainer, your
kernel file should look something like this (remember to replace
`/path/to/remage_latest.sif` with your actual path):

```json
{
  "argv": [
    "sh",
    "-c",
    "apptainer exec -B $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR /path/to/remage_latest.sif python -m ipykernel_launcher -f {connection_file}"
  ],
  "display_name": "remage container",
  "language": "python",
  "metadata": {
    "debugger": true
  }
}
```

Now after refreshing JupyterLab/VSCode you should be able to find the "remage
container" kernel in your notebooks!

:::{warning}

Interactive visualization, like the pyg4ometry or Geant4 visualizer, might
not work as expected in a notebook.
